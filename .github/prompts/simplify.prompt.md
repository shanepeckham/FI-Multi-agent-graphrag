## General Instructions
- Look at ways of simplifying the code by removing instructions that are not necessary to achieve the intended purpose.
- Favour ways of coding that are easier to read for a person rather than using new language features that are not as readable.
- If possible, code should be readable in such a way as to not require comments to explain what the code is doing.
